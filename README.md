# End to End Automation

## Plan 

Draw FIRST (create scrum board, draw diagram, daily sprint)

Phase 1: (Friday till development bit: push from lh, triggers webhook, deployment)
-	Build small python package
-	Readme > set of instructions 
-	Two access (admin and user)
-	Admin: Upload csv with someone’s basic calculations 
-	User (who are we building it for – test takers): interface pops up (5 quest test, results given)
-	Has to have database (relational, SQL)
-	Use Django makes life easy

Phase 2:
- Docker 
- Kubernetes
- Jenkins > terraform > ansible 

Research: 
- Flask or Django (for scaling must detached) – research 
- For mac, linux, windows (need to work everywhere)(create readme instructions)(see on tablets, phones, common browsers after)
- Work on its own interface or browser 
- Static or dynamic (probs dynamic as calcs would be difficult on static)

Principles:
- Apply OOP
- DRY
